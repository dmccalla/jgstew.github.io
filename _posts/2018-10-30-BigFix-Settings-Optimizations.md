## BigFix is Extremely Flexible

- There are tons of setting that can be tweaked for almost every part of the BigFix platform.
- No matter what your use case is, there is a setting that can help!

## Many Defaults Should Be Changed!

- There are many default BigFix Settings that are sub-optimal for almost all use cases!
- BigFix is very conservative about Defaults, and especially changing them once they have been established.
