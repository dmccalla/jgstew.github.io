## BigFix is Extremely Flexible

- There are tons of setting that can be tweaked for almost every part of the BigFix platform.
  - Root Server: `_BESRelay_` & `_BESGather_`
  - Relays: `_BESRelay_` & `_BESGather_`
  - Clients: `_BESClient_`
  - and more!
- No matter what your use case is, there is a setting that can help!


## Many Defaults Should Be Changed!

- There are many default BigFix Settings that are sub-optimal for almost all use cases!
  - This will cover the ones with the biggest impact, that are also safest to deploy.
- BigFix is very conservative about Defaults, and especially changing them once they have been established.


## _BESClient_Resource_PowerSaveEnable

### Default: Disabled (0)

### Recommendation: Enabled (1)

- This setting should be enabled on:
  - Laptops
  - VMs
  - Docker Containers
  - & probably everything else
- This setting tells the client to stop evaluating relevance if things are not changing.


## _BESRelay_HealthCheck_EnableAtStartup

### Default: Disabled (0)

### Recommendation: Enabled (1)

- Applies to Relays
- HealthCheck process validates site data integrity, and re-requests any site data that is corrupt so it can be properly served to clients.
- Can Fix `FAILED to Synchronize` errors in client logs


## _BESClient_Log_Days

### Default: 10 days (10)

### Recommendation: 31 days (31)

- This setting controls how many log files the client will keep before deleting the oldest. 
- The default of 10 days is often too short to catch issues before logs are rotated.


## _BESRelay_RelaysFileUpdater_RefreshSeconds

### Default: 1 minute (60)

### Recommendation: 1 hour (3600) or more

Applicability: root server only (exists main gather service)
- This setting controls how often the Relays.dat file is propagated through the master action site when new Relays are created.
- This setting matters most if new Relays are created frequently, so it may not need to be changed for most environments, but the default setting is extremely aggressive.
