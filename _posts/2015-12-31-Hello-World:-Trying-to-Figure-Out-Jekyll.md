Hello World. Trying to figure out Jekyll is both easy and hard. As I get the hang of it, I am liking it, but I do wish the learning curve was a bit easier. 

Overall I really like the idea of a dynamically generated static webpage creator. It is a very smart idea, and being able to make use of it directly through [GitHub](https://github.com/jgstew) with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is even better.
